                            <p>C. elegans worms are organisms which are studied in-order to gain
                                an understanding of other things. For example, researchers investigated the behaviour of these worms 
                                in order to detect the presence of environmental toxins in the soil (<a href="https://hwbdocs.env.nm.gov/Los%20Alamos%20National%20Labs/References/9590.PDF">source</a>). 
                                Similarly, there is ongoing research on analysing C.elegans mating behaviours in an attempt to reveal soil conditions with regards to pollution (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165993621000583#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20Caenorhabditis%20elegans,along%20with%20relieving%20ethical%20constraints.">source</a>). 
                                However, the manual method of observing their mating process is time-consuming, restricting the scope and efficiency of comprehensive studies. For this reason, there is a need for an automated analysis tool.

                                <br><br><br>I worked remotely with two professors from the University of Reading alongside other researchers.
                                My contribution to the team was to design, implement, evaluate and provide a detailed report on the system proposed in this study.

                            <p>The system proposed in this study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model - YOLO in this case - to detect and localise worms in a video, while using DeepSORT to track the detected worms. Although these two algorithms are considered to 
                                be state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, the combined performance in this case study was poor. The YOLO model would wrongly classify worm imprints as worms while the DeepSORT tracker would often lose track of worms thinking an already tracked worm is a new worm. In an attempt to improve the system's tracking performance, image segmentation was introduced. Initially, adaptive thresholding was utilised but to little avail. We then opted to use Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM).
                             Below is the system's design:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pass video frames into the YOLO model to detect and localise worms</li>
                                    <li>Pass detected bounding boxes of the worms into the SAM model so we can segment each worm from the background</li>
                                    <li>Pass in the new frame containing detected worms (now white) in a black background into DeepSORT for tracking</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>As mentioned earlier, this study aimed to make available, a tool for the automated mating analysis of C. elegans. Although we were able to track worms, 
                                a more important task is to detect mating instances in a video. To do this, we need to first of all, identify the different genders in a video (i.e., 
                                identify the male and female worms). It is observed in the videos, that the male worm is more mobile than the female worms. We leveraged this fact to 
                                develop a gender identification algorithm. This works by recording the location of all worms in the first frame of a video and after a few frames, we 
                                record each worm's new location and compute the distance between their current location and their initial location using the Euclidean distance formula. 
                                The worm with the largest distance (i.e., the worm that has moved the farthest) is identified as the male worm and the others as female worms.<br><br>
                                After identifying the genders, there is a need to then detect any mating occurence between the male worm and any of the 5 female worms. To do this, we compute 
                                the Euclidean distance between the male worm and the female worms. If the distance falls below a speicified threshold, we indicate contact.

                            <p>The system, now equipped with SOTA and modest custom algorithms achieves an okay result. However, 
                                due to our strive for excellence, we ventured into making modifications on the DeepSORT algorithm which yielded 
                                very positive results. The videos used in this study consists of 5 female worms and 1 male worm (total of 6 worms). 
                                We leveraged this and modified the DeepSORT algorithm such that after the system detects 6 worms, we caution it 
                                not to easily detect any new worm or object.<br><br>There is ongoing work on making a more detailed report of this study
