										<!-- <p>I am a data scientist with 4 years of experience and also an AI enthusiast who absolutely loves working on problems to provide data-led solutions. 
											My passion for data science is reflected in the personal projects I undertake, where I not only expand my expertise but also craft practical solutions to real problems. 
											Equipped with an MSc in data science and four years of hands-on experience, I possess the skills and knowledge to tackle a wide range of data science projects.
											I am eager and excited to work with you on any such endeavours.
											</p> -->

										<h3 class="new-major">Skills</h3>
										<p>Data science consists of machine learning, data analysis, data engineering, and software engineering. As a data scientist with about 4 years of experience, 
											I have honed my skills in this 4 areas and provide more details below. This section aims to be an "All you need to know about Me" section, however, please feel free to go through my projects and experiences for a little bit more detail.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Machine Learning</h2>
										<p>From training statistical models like linear regression on tabular data to implementing sophisticated state-of-the-art models like YOLO, BERT, DeepSORT, and GPT on pictorial and 
											textual data, I have cultivated a strong proficiency in machine learning.<br><br>Projects showcasing my machine learning skills include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
											  Reliance Health:Developed BERT and sequential models to classify claims' diagnoses, resulting in increased profit. Conducted detailed data analysis to illustrate the impact of the classification model, which led to an improved insurance pricing model.
											</li>
											<li>
											  Ehealth4Everyone:Created an NLP system using Gensim to map keywords to documents and determine word similarity using cosine distance.
											</li>
											<li>
											  University of Reading (Research Volunteer):Designed a detection, tracking, and analysis system using PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, etc.
											</li>
											<li>
											  Multi-label Image Classification Project: Built a system facilitating the implementation of the OvA approach for image classification using TensorFlow.

										<h2 class="major">Data Analysis</h2>
										<p>As a data scientist, I excel in storytelling through data visualization. Over the years, I've enhanced my skills using tools like PowerBI, Excel, Tableau, and Python to effectively 
											communicate insights from data analysis and machine learning models.
											<br><br>Examples of my data analysis endeavors include:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Reliance Health: After developing a highly accurate claims' diagnoses classification model, I performed intricate data analysis to visualise to stake holders, the positive effect this new model can have on the company. The analysis included showing the amount 
													of money spent on certain types of diseases or claims, showing the demographic risks (for instance, how young married women are more likely to make obstetrics care claims and how much we spend on obstetrcis care yearly), etc. This led to an improved insurrance pricing model.</li>
												<li>Softcom: Performed geo-spatial analysis for telecommunications companies, aiding decision-making by highlighting outlet concentrations and areas for potential expansion.</li>

										<h2 class="major">Data and Software Engineering</h2>
										<p>In my role as a data scientist, I often tackle software development and data engineering tasks, enhancing my skills in SQL, HTML, CSS, Python (Django), CI/CD, OOP, unit testing, version control (Git), concurrency
											(multiprocessing and threading in Python), and APIs.
										   <br><br>Instances where I applied my data and software engineering skills include:</p>

										   <ul>
											   <li>Reliance Health: Developed a web application using HTML, CSS, and Python to host a demo pricing model.</li>
											   <li>Ehealth4Everyone: Migrated a database from CouchDB to PostgreSQL using SQL and Python.</li>
											   <li>Ehealth4Everyone: Engineered a notification system for parental vaccination reminders using Python and API calls.</li>
											   <li>University of Reading (Research Volunteer): Designed a system utilizing machine learning models and custom algorithms for video object tracking and analysis.</li>
											   <li>Python Emailing Package: Created a Python emailing package addressing a previously unmet need, garnering over 8,000 downloads in its first year of release.</li>
